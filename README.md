# CLI Sorting Algorithms in Node.js

This project is an interactive command line application that implements popular sorting algorithms in Node.js. It provides an easy way to test and understand different sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, QuickSort and MergeSort.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masechkacat/CLI-SortingAlgorithms-NodeJS.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CLI-SortingAlgorithms-NodeJS
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```
### Using the Application

1. After starting the application, you will be prompted to enter an array of numbers separated by spaces.
2. Next, choose the sorting algorithm you want to use (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, QuickSort).
3. The application will then display the sorted array and the number of iterations used for the selected sorting algorithm.
